This should be at most a page of information about the purpose of your application and any background information about the domain that may be needed by your test users to understand it. Make your briefing short, clear and concise, it should not describe how to use the interface.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Shride is a rideshare application that focuses on the internal community as a resource for transportation. Travelling by car can be difficult to finagle at Wellesley-- you can find rides on facebook, email, and spreadsheets, but it is altogether too chaotic to navigate. The goal in mind with Shride is to centralize the &ldquo;need ride&rdquo; messages sent out on public forums into one location and simplify the process of finding student drivers (who will likely charge less than a taxi service or nationwide rideshare application user). &nbsp;We also hope to provide a safer and more comfortable experience to users as all interactions are between Wellesley students. &nbsp;Inspired by Uber and Carma Carpool, we hope to change the way student transportation is run, both to reduce our carbon footprint and create a more tight knit community.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Write your 3 scenario tasks on separate index cards. Just write the concrete goals of the task (e.g. &quot;use this mobile app to buy milk, tomatoes, and bread&quot;). Don&#39;t write the specific steps to follow, since that&#39;s for your users to figure out. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span></span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_y1b64p42qbk0-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c2"><span>Create a profile</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Join a ride (as a rider)</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Make a ride (as a driver)</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Observations.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Usability problems you discovered from the testing.
