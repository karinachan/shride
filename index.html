<p> Shride is a Wellesley-only ride share application developed
    by Karina Chan, Kate Hunt, and Alison Savage.  Ride service
    apps have changed the way people travel, for both leisure
    and on a day to day basis. At Wellesley, in particular, it
    is easy to pop out our mobile phones and quickly order a
    vehicle to give us a ride. Convenience is important and we
    believe that we can change the way people approach
    transportation by harnessing the community within campus.
    Unnecessarily ordering individual cars from one of today's
    popular ride share apps when one of your peers happens to
    be driving or needing the same ride into Boston/Cambridge
    is wasteful. The current communal spreadsheet is not an
    efficient or user-friendly way to facilitate ride sharing.
    We hope to create an app that will promote sharing rides
    with members of the Wellesley community in a safe and
    simple way. </p>
